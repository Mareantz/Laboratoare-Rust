# K9 - A Doctor Who Discord Bot

K9 is a Discord bot built with Rust and the Shuttle library. It's designed to engage Doctor Who fans with trivia and fun commands.

## Features

- **Quote**: Sends a random Doctor Who quote.
- **Doctor**: Sends a picture of the n-th Doctor.
- **Episode**: Searches all the titles of all episodes for the given text, and prints the information about that episode (title, runtime, season/episode number). The episodes are up to the 12th season (March 2020).
- **Points**: Prints a leaderboard showing how many points each user has.

In addition to these commands, K9 also posts random trivia questions about the show at regular intervals. The first user to reply with the correct answer gets a point.

## How to Use

To use K9, invite it to your Discord server and type one of the commands in a text channel. For example, to get a random quote, type `!quote`.
